# Steagnography Project

The implemented Steganography project leverages Python programming for its backend logic and processing. Using libraries like OpenCV and NumPy, the application embeds secret messages within images while maintaining their visual integrity. 
The project includes a user-friendly interface developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, facilitating seamless interaction for encoding and decoding messages. Key features encompass robust encryption methods for data security, real-time preview of modified images, and efficient extraction of hidden messages. 
The implementation emphasizes scalability and efficiency, ensuring reliable performance across different platforms and browsers.
